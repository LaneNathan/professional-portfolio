# professional-portfolio
This project was my chance to display some of the things i've learned in class up until this point. In the below link you'll be able to access the project where I created links to some of my previous work and assigned them to their corresponding images. I displayed the contents in a layout that was given in the acceptance criteria of the challenge and set new layouts for various screen sizes.
