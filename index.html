    <p>My name is Nathan Lane. I'm a future full stack developer,currently taking Web Development classes at EDX thru UNCC. Originally from Buffalo,NY, I moved to Charlotte,NC in 2013. I've decide to pursue a career in Software Development because of my love for design and figuring out how the pieces work together to make things run. Here I'll present projects that I've worked on throughout my time as a developer. Check it out and please have fun! </p>

    <p>Here I showcase my ability to work on Refractoring code. The above link refers to the first challenge of my class, where we were able to look at the Horiseonw website and clean up the code. In this challenge we worked on a "On-the-job ticket" style project where we viewed the source code for the website, improved upom the code's readability, maintainability, and/or performance without altering its functionality.</p>
