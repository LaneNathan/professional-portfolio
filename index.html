    <p>My name is Nathan Lane. I'm a future full stack developer,currently taking Web Development classes at EDX thru UNCC. Originally from Buffalo,NY, I moved to Charlotte,NC in 2013. I've decide to pursue a career in Software Development because of my love for design and figuring out how the pieces work together to make things run. Here I'll present projects that I've worked on throughout my time as a developer. Check it out and please have fun! </p>
